represents the following:

<unix timestamp>_<user name>_<user unique id>_<user first name(if available)>_<user last name(if available)>_<SHA256 hash sum of the file content>_<name of a file>.<file extension>


<unix timestamp>
    is the number representing the date and time when a file has been uploaded
    can be converted into a human-readable format using this website

<user_name>
    @nickname of a user, which they are using for referencing and searching their telegram account

<user unique id>
    is a number assigned by telegram when user created their account
    this number is persistent over time and does not change when the user
    changes their username, last, or first name
    
<user first name(if available)>
    the first name of a user, telegram supports Unicode so it can have very fancy characters
    when the user did not specify their first name, our engine will put a placeholder 'userfname'

<user last name(if available)>
    the last name of a user, telegram supports Unicode so it can have very fancy characters
    when the user did not specify their first name, our engine will put a placeholder 'userlname'

<SHA256 hash sum of the file content>
    to avoid duplicate files, we are checking the binary file content and generating the string using SHA256 encoding algorithm
    if there are several files, which are renamed copies of one file - we will keep only one of these files
    if there are several files, which are the same image but saved as different file types - we keep all of them
    
<name of a file>
    name of a file, when the user is sending photos our engine uses placeholder 'photo' and when file - we write 'file'

<file extension>
    png, jpeg, jpg, txt
    when user is sending photos engine puts 'jpg'
